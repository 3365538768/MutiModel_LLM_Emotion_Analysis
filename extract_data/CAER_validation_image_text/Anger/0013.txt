In the scene, a person is standing in front of a counter with a woman sitting on the other side of it. The man's facial expression and emotion are difficult to determine as he is not shown directly facing the camera. However, his body language suggests that he might be interested in the conversation between the two individuals.


The person's posture appears relaxed, but he is also looking away from the camera, which could imply that he is trying to avoid being recorded or is not comfortable with the situation. Additionally, the man is leaning towards the woman, which could indicate that he is listening intently to what she has to say. His overall demeanor seems curious and engaged in the conversation, which suggests that he might be invested in the interaction.
